An implementation of Viterbi algorithm for finding the most likely explanation, of a given sequence, in an HMM (Hidden Markov model).

## Description
* Prompts the user to select either using one of the predefined HMMs (11.4, 11.6), or instead creating a new one.

(Note: Installation of Python libraries math and deque (from Collections) is required.)

## Predefined HMMs
